Learn how to use MicroProfile GraphQL to query and update data from multiple services.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and use a simple GraphQL service with 
https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpGraphQL-1.0.html[MicroProfile GraphQL^]. 

GraphQL is an open source data query language.
Unlike REST APIs, each `POST` request that is sent to a GraphQL service goes to a single HTTP endpoint. 
Create, read, update, and delete operations and their details are differentiated by the contents of the request.
If the operation returns data, the user specifies what properties of the data that they want returned. 
For read operations, a JSON object is returned that contains only the data and properties that are specified.
For other operations, a JSON object might be returned containing information such as a success message. 

Returning only the specified properties in a read operation has two benefits.
If you're dealing with large amounts of data or large resources, 
it reduces the size of the responses.
If you have properties that are expensive to calculate or retrieve (such as nested objects), 
it also saves processing time.
GraphQL will only calculate these properties if they're requested.

A GraphQL service can also be used to obtain data from multiple sources such as APIs, databases, or other services.
It can then collate this data into a single object for the user.
This simplifies data retrieval as the user only makes a single request to the GraphQL service,
instead of multiple requests to the individual data sources.

You can learn more about GraphQL at the https://graphql.org/[GraphQL website^].

You'll create a GraphQL application that retrieves data from multiple `system` services.
Users will make requests to the GraphQL service, which will then make requests to the `system` services.
The GraphQL service will return a single JSON object containing all the system information from the `system` services.

The guide application includes an interactive GraphQL tool called
https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql[GraphiQL^].
GraphiQL helps you make queries to a GraphQL service. 
In the GraphiQL UI, you need to type only the body of the query for the purposes of manual tests and examples. 

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed.
For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].
You will build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Creating GraphQL object types

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

Object types define the structure of the data returned by GraphQL. 
Annotations that are applied to the declaration and properties of Java classes define object types.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `JavaInfo` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/JavaInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=0]`JavaInfo` class is annotated with an `@Type` annotation. 
The [hotspot=type file=0]`@Type("java")` annotation maps this class to define the `java` object type in GraphQL.
The `java` object type gives information on the Java installation of the system. 

The [hotspot=description file=0]`@Description` annotation gives a description to the `java` object type in GraphQL.
This description is what appears in the schema and the documentation. 
Descriptions aren't required, but it's good practice to include them. 

The [hotspot=name file=0]`@Name` annotation maps the `vendor` property 
to the `vendorName` property of the `java` object type in GraphQL. 
The [hotspot=name file=0]`@Name` annotation is used when mapping a property in a Java object 
to a property of a different name in the GraphQL object type.
Without an [hotspot=name file=0]`@Name` annotation, the Java object property is automatically 
mapped to a GraphQL object type property of the same name. 

All data types in GraphQL are nullable by default.
Non-nullable properties are annotated with the [hotspot=nonnull file=0]`@NonNull` annotation.
The [hotspot=getVendor file=0]`getVendor()` and [hotspot=getVersion file=0]`getVersion()` getter functions 
are automatically mapped to retrieve their respective properties in GraphQL. 
If needed, setter functions are also supported and automatically mapped. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `OperatingSystem` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/OperatingSystem.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=1]`OperatingSystem` class is set up similarly.
It maps to the [hotspot=type file=1]`operatingSystem` object type, which describes the operating system's information. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemInfo` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=2]`SystemInfo` class is similar to the previous two files. 
It maps to the [hotspot=type file=2]`system` object type, 
which describes other information Java can retrieve from the system properties.

The `java` and `operatingSystem` object types are used as nested objects within the `system` object type.
However, nested objects and other properties that are expensive to calculate or retrieve 
are not included in the class of an object type.
Instead, expensive properties are added as part of implementing GraphQL resolvers. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=3" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemLoad` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemLoad.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=3]`SystemLoad` class is similar to the previous files.
It maps to the [hotspot=type file=3]`systemLoad` object type, 
which describes the resources usage of a `system` service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=4" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemLoadData` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemLoadData.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=4]`SystemLoadData` class will map to the `loadData` object type.
It will describe be another nested object that will be inside the `systemLoad` object type.
It will describe the details of the resource usage of a `system` service.

== Implementing system service

GraphQL needs a way to access information about the `system` microservices for this example.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemPropertiesResource` class.#
`system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemPropertiesResource.java`
----

The [hotspot file=0]`SystemPropertiesResource` class provides endpoints to interact with the system properties.
The [hotspot=queryProperty file=0]`{property}` endpoint accesses system properties.
The [hotspot=java file=0]`java` endpoint assembles and returns an object describing the system's Java installation.
The [hotspot=note file=0]`note` endpoint is used to write a note into the system properties.

[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemManagementResource` class.#
`system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemManagementResource.java`
----

The [hotspot file=1]`SystemMangaementResource` class provides information on the system's operating system and resource management.
The [hotspot=operatingSystem file=1]`operatingSystem` endpoint assembles and returns an object describing the operating system.
The [hotspot=systemLoad file=1]`systemLoad` endpoint assembles and returns an object describing the system load.
It will include how much of the JVM heap is being used and how load the processor is under.

----

== Implementing GraphQL resolvers

Resolvers are functions that provide instructions for GraphQL operations.
Each operation requires a corresponding resolver.
The `query` operation type is read-only and fetches data.
The `mutation` operation type can create, delete, or modify data. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `GraphQLService` class.#
`graphql/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/GraphQLService.java`
----

The resolvers are defined in the [hotspot file=0]`GraphQLService.java` file.
The [hotspot=graphqlapi file=0]`@GraphQLApi` annotation 
enables GraphQL to use the methods that are defined in this class as resolvers. 

Operations of the `query` type are read-only operations that retrieve data.
They're defined by using the [hotspot=query1 hotspot=query2 file=0]`@Query` annotation.
There are two functions defined and mapped to `query` operations.

The [hotspot=getSystemInfo file=0]`getSystemInfo()` function handles `system` requests.
It retrieves and bundles system information into a `SystemInfo` object that is returned.

The [hotspot=getSystemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad()` function handles `systemLoad` requests.
It will assemble an array of `SystemLoad` objects to describe the resource usage of `system` services.

Both of these functions have an [hotspot=getSystemLoadHeader hotspot=getSystemInfoHeader file=0]`@Name` annotation on their inputs.
The `@Name` annotation is used to denote inputs for a GraphQL resolver.
Here it is used to specify a `hostname` of a system to look up information for.
In the case of the [hotspot=getSystemLoadHeader]`getSystemLoad()` function, it specifies an array `hostnames`
to be input to retrieve information from multiple systems.

The [hotspot=mutation file=0]`@Mutation` annotation maps functions to operations of the `mutation` type.
Operations of the `mutation` type modify data.
They create, update, or delete data. 
A single function is defined and mapped to a `mutation` operation.

The [hotspot=editNoteFunction file=0]`editNote()` function handles `editNote` operations.
The [hotspot=editNoteHeader file=0]`@Name` annotation denotes a `hostname` input, which specifies which `hostname` is being edited.
Another [hotspot=editNoteHeader file=0]`@Name` annotation is used for the `note` input,
which is used to determine what note to write into the system properties of the given `hostname`. 

Each resolver function has an [hotspot=description1 hotspot=description2 hotspot=description3 file=0]`@Description` 
annotation, which provides a description to be used for the schema. 
Descriptions aren't required, but it's good practice to include them. 



The [hotspot=operatingSystemHeader hotspot=javaHeader hotspot=loadDataHeader file=0]`@Source` annotation
is used to add properties to object types.
In this application, it adds the [hotspot=javaFunction file=0]`java` and [hotspot=os file=0]`operatingSystem`
object types as properties of the `system` object type.
The [hotspot=loadDataHeader file=0]`@Source` annotation is also used to add the [hotspot=loadData file=0]`loadData`
object type as a property of the `systemLoad` object type.

The [hotspot=operatingSystemHeader hotspot=javaHeader hotspot=loadDataHeader file=0]`@Source` annotation
is used for any properties that are expensive to calculate or search for.
These properties are calculated or searched for only if requested, which saves processing time and resources.

== Enabling GraphQL

To use GraphQL, the MicroProfile GraphQL dependencies and features need to be included. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the Maven project file.#
`graphql/pom.xml`
----

Adding the [hotspot=graphQLDependency file=0]`microprofile-graphql-api` dependency to the [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` 
enables the GraphQL annotations that are used to develop the application. 

The Open Liberty server needs to be configured to support the GraphQL query language. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`graphql/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

The [hotspot=graphql file=1]`mpGraphQL-1.0` feature that is added to the [hotspot file=1]`server.xml` 
enables the use of the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpGraphQL-1.0.html[MicroProfile GraphQL^] 
feature in Open Liberty.

----
include::finish/graphql/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

== Building and running the application

From the `start` directory, run the following commands:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl models install
mvn clean package
----

The `mvn install` command compiles and packages the object types you created to a `.jar` file.
This allows them to be used by the `system` and `graphql` services.
The `mvn package` command packages the `system` and `graphql` services. 

Dockerfiles have already been set up for you.
Build your Docker images with the following commands:

[role='command']
----
docker build -t system:1.0-java8-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java8 system/.
docker build -t system:1.0-java11-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 system/.
docker build -t graphql:1.0-SNAPSHOT graphql/.
----

The `--build-arg` parameter is used to create two different `system` services.
One will use Java 8, while the other will use Java 11.
Run these Docker images using the provided `startContainers` script.
The script will create a network for the services to communicate through.
It will create the two `system` services and a GraphQL service. 

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

The containers may take some time to become available.

== Running GraphQL queries

Before making any requests, visit the http://localhost:9080/graphql/schema.graphql[^] URL.
This URL contains the schema, which describes the GraphQL service.
The schema details what operations are available and any object types that are returned.
Object types described will have their fields and their types listed.
If defined, descriptions of object types and operations will also be included.

To access the GraphQL service, GraphiQL has already been set up and included for you.
Access GraphiQL at the http://localhost:9080/graphiql.html[^] URL.
Queries that are made through GraphiQL are the same as queries that are made through HTTP requests.
You can also view the schema through GraphiQL by clicking the `Docs` button on the menu bar.

Run the following `query` operation in GraphiQL to get every system property from the container running on Java 8:

[role='command']
----
query {
  system(hostname:"java8") {
    hostname
    username
    timezone
    java {
      vendorName
      version
    }
    operatingSystem {
      arch
      name
      version
    }
  }
}
----

The output is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "hostname": "java8",
      "username": "default",
      "timezone": "Etc/UTC",
      "java": {
        "vendorName": "AdoptOpenJDK",
        "version": "1.8.0_292"
      },
      "operatingSystem": {
        "arch": "amd64",
        "name": "Linux",
        "version": "5.10.25-linuxkit"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Run the following mutation operation to add a note to the `system` service running on Java 8:

[role='command']
----
mutation {
  editNote(
    hostname: "java8"
    note: "I'm trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
  )
}
----

You receive a response containing the Boolean `true` to let you know that the request was successfully processed.
You can see the note that you added by running the following query operation.
Notice that there is no need to run a full query, as you only want the `note` property.
Thus, the request only contains the `note` property. 

[role='command']
----
query {
  system(hostname: "java8") {
    note
  }
}
----

The response is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "note": "I'm trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
    }
  }
}
----

GraphQL returns only the `note` property, as it was the only property in the request.
You can try out the operations using the hostname `java11` as well.
To see an example of using an array as an input for an operation, try the following operation to get system loads:

[role='command']
----
query {
  systemLoad(hostnames: ["java8", "java11"]) {
    hostname
    loadData {
      heapUsed
      loadAverage
    }
  }
}
----

The response is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "systemLoad": [
      {
        "hostname": "java8",
        "loadData": {
          "heapUsed": 39762056,
          "loadAverage": 0.42
        }
      },
      {
        "hostname": "java11",
        "loadData": {
          "heapUsed": 38604048,
          "loadAverage": 0.42
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

== Tearing down the environment

When you're done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

== Great work! You're done!

You just created a basic GraphQL service using MicroProfile GraphQL in Open Liberty!
