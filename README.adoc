= Optimizing REST queries for microservices with GraphQL

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form,
view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to use MicroProfile GraphQL to query and update data from multiple services,
and how to test GraphQL queries and mutations using an interactive GraphQL tool (GraphiQL).

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and use a simple GraphQL service with 
https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpGraphQL-1.0.html[MicroProfile GraphQL^]. 

GraphQL is an open source data query language.
Unlike REST APIs, each HTTP request that is sent to a GraphQL service goes to a single HTTP endpoint.
Create, read, update, and delete operations and their details are differentiated by the contents of the request.
If the operation returns data, the user specifies what properties of the data that they want returned. 
For read operations, a JSON object is returned that contains only the data and properties that are specified.
For other operations, a JSON object might be returned containing information such as a success message. 

Returning only the specified properties in a read operation has two benefits.
If you're dealing with large amounts of data or large resources, 
it reduces the size of the responses.
If you have properties that are expensive to calculate or retrieve (such as nested objects), 
it also saves processing time.
GraphQL calculates these properties only if they are requested. 

A GraphQL service can also be used to obtain data from multiple sources such as APIs, databases, and other services. 
It can then collate this data into a single object for the user, simplifying the data retrieval. 
The user makes only a single request to the GraphQL service, instead of multiple requests to the individual data sources.
GraphQL services require less data fetching than REST services, 
which results in lower application load times and lower data transfer costs. 
GraphQL also enables clients to better customize requests to the server.

All of the available operations to retrieve or modify data are available in a single GraphQL schema.
The GraphQL schema describes all the data types that are used in the GraphQL service.
The schema also describes all of the available operations.
As well, you can add names and text descriptions to the various object types and operations in the schema.

You can learn more about GraphQL at the https://graphql.org/[GraphQL website^].

You'll create a GraphQL application that retrieves data from multiple `system` services. 
Users make requests to the GraphQL service, which then makes requests to the `system` services. 
The GraphQL service returns a single JSON object containing all the system information from the `system` services.

image::architecture.png[GraphQL architecture where multiple system microservices are integrated behind one GraphQL service, align="center"]

You'll enable the interactive
https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql[GraphiQL^] tool in the Open Liberty runtime.
GraphiQL helps you make queries to a GraphQL service.
In the GraphiQL UI, you need to type only the body of the query for the purposes of manual tests and examples. 

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed.
For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].
You'll build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Creating GraphQL object types

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.
// cloud hosted instructions
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
cd /home/project/guide-microprofile-graphql/start
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

Object types determine the structure of the data that GraphQL returns. 
These object types are defined by annotations that are applied to the declaration and properties of Java classes. 

You will define `java`, `systemMetrics`, and `systemInfo` object types by creating and applying annotations to the `JavaInfo`, `SystemMetrics`, and `SystemInfo` classes respectively. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `JavaInfo` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/JavaInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=0]`JavaInfo` class is annotated with a `@Type` annotation. 
The [hotspot=type file=0]`@Type("java")` annotation maps this class to define the `java` object type in GraphQL.
The `java` object type gives information on the Java installation of the system. 

The [hotspot=description file=0]`@Description` annotation gives a description to the `java` object type in GraphQL.
This description is what appears in the schema and the documentation. 
Descriptions aren't required, but it's good practice to include them. 

The [hotspot=name file=0]`@Name` annotation maps the `vendor` property 
to the `vendorName` name of the `java` object type in GraphQL. 
The `@Name` annotation can be used to change the name of the property used in the schema.
Without a `@Name` annotation, the Java object property is automatically 
mapped to a GraphQL object type property of the same name. 
In this case, without the `@Name` annotation, the property would be displayed as `vendor` in the schema.

All data types in GraphQL are nullable by default.
Non-nullable properties are annotated with the [hotspot=nonnull file=0]`@NonNull` annotation.
The [hotspot=nonnull file=0]`@NonNull` annotation on the [hotspot=version file=0]`version` field ensures that, 
when queried, a non-null value is returned by the GraphQL service. 
The [hotspot=getVendor file=0]`getVendor()` and [hotspot=getVersion file=0]`getVersion()` getter functions 
are automatically mapped to retrieve their respective properties in GraphQL. 
If needed, setter functions are also supported and automatically mapped. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemMetrics` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemMetrics.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=1]`SystemMetrics` class is set up similarly.
It maps to the [hotspot=type file=1]`systemMetrics` object type,
which describes system information such as the number of processor cores and the heap size.

[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemInfo` class.#
`models/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot=class file=2]`SystemInfo` class is similar to the previous two classes. 
It maps to the [hotspot=type file=2]`system` object type, 
which describes other information Java can retrieve from the system properties.

The [hotspot=java file=2]`java` and [hotspot=metrics file=2]`systemMetrics` object types are used as nested objects within the `system` object type.
However, nested objects and other properties that are expensive to calculate or retrieve 
are not included in the class of an object type.
Instead, expensive properties are added as part of implementing GraphQL resolvers. 

To save time, the [hotspot=class file=3]`SystemLoad` class and
[hotspot=class file=4]`SystemLoadData` class are provided for you.
The `SystemLoad` class maps to the [hotspot=type file=3]`systemLoad`
object type, which describes the resource usage of a `system` service.
The `SystemLoadData` class maps to the [hotspot=type file=4]`loadData` object type.
The `loadData` object will be a nested object inside the `systemLoad` object type.
Together, these objects will contain the details of the resource usage of a `system` service.

== Implementing system service

The `system` microservices are backend services that use JAX-RS.
For more details on using JAX-RS, see the
https://www.openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service guide^].
These `system` microservices report system properties.
GraphQL can access multiple instances of these `system` microservices and collate their information.
In a real scenario, GraphQL might access multiple databases or other services.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemPropertiesResource` class.#
`system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemPropertiesResource.java`
----

The [hotspot file=0]`SystemPropertiesResource` class provides endpoints to interact with the system properties.
The [hotspot=queryProperty file=0]`properties/{property}` endpoint accesses system properties.
The [hotspot=java file=0]`properties/java` endpoint assembles and returns an object describing the system's Java installation.
The [hotspot=note file=0]`note` endpoint is used to write a note into the system properties.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemMetricsResource` class.#
`system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemMetricsResource.java`
----

The [hotspot file=1]`SystemMetricsResource` class provides information on the system resources and their usage.
The [hotspot=systemLoad file=1]`systemLoad` endpoint assembles and returns an object that describes the system load. 
It includes the JVM heap load and processor load.

== Implementing GraphQL resolvers

Resolvers are functions that provide instructions for GraphQL operations.
Each operation requires a corresponding resolver.
The `query` operation type is read-only and fetches data.
The `mutation` operation type can create, delete, or modify data. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `GraphQLService` class.#
`graphql/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/GraphQLService.java`
----

The resolvers are defined in the [hotspot file=0]`GraphQLService.java` file.
The [hotspot=graphqlapi file=0]`@GraphQLApi` annotation 
enables GraphQL to use the methods that are defined in this class as resolvers.

Operations of the `query` type are read-only operations that retrieve data.
They're defined by using the [hotspot=query1 hotspot=query2 file=0]`@Query` annotation.

One of the `query` requests in this application is the `system` request.
This request is handled by the [hotspot=getSystemInfo file=0]`getSystemInfo()` function.
It retrieves and bundles system information into a `SystemInfo` object that is returned.

It uses a [hotspot=getSystemInfoHeader file=0]`@Name` on one of its input parameters.
The `@Name` annotation has different functions depending on the context in which it's used.
In this context, it denotes input parameters for GraphQL operations.
For the [hotspot=getSystemInfo file=0]`getSystemInfo()` function,
it's used to input the `hostname` for the system you want to look up information for.

Recall that the `SystemInfo` class contained nested objects.
It contained a `JavaInfo` and an `SystemMetrics` object.
The [hotspot=systemMetricsHeader hotspot=javaHeader file=0]`@Source` annotation
is used to add these nested objects as properties to the `SystemInfo` object.

The [hotspot=systemMetricsHeader hotspot=javaHeader file=0]`@Name` appears again here.
In this context alongside the [hotspot=systemMetricsHeader hotspot=javaHeader file=0]`@Source` annotation,
it's used to connect the [hotspot=javaFunction file=0]`java` and [hotspot=systemMetricsFunction file=0]`systemMetrics`
object types to `system` requests and the `system` object type.

The other `query` request is the `systemLoad` request, 
which is handled by the [hotspot=getSystemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad()` function.
The `systemLoad` request retrieves information about the resource usage of any number of system services.
It accepts an array of `hostnames` as the input for the systems to look up.
It's set up similarly to the `system` request, with the [hotspot=loadData file=0]`loadData` function
used for the nested `SystemLoadData` object.

Operations of the `mutation` type are used to edit data. 
They can create, update, or delete data.
They're defined by using the [hotspot=mutation file=0]`@Mutation` annotation.

There's one `mutation` operation in this application - the `editNote` request.
This request is handled by the [hotspot=editNoteFunction file=0]`editNote()` function.
This request is used to write a note into the properties of a given system.
There are inputs for the system you want to write into, and the note you want to write.

Each resolver function has a [hotspot=description1 hotspot=description2 hotspot=description3 file=0]`@Description` 
annotation, which provides a description that is used for the schema.
Descriptions aren't required, but it's good practice to include them.

== Enabling GraphQL

To use GraphQL, the MicroProfile GraphQL dependencies and features need to be included. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the Maven project file.#
`graphql/pom.xml`
----

Adding the [hotspot=graphQLDependency file=0]`microprofile-graphql-api` dependency to the [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` 
enables the GraphQL annotations that are used to develop the application. 

The Open Liberty server needs to be configured to support the GraphQL query language. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`graphql/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

The [hotspot=graphql file=1]`mpGraphQL-1.0` feature that is added to the [hotspot file=1]`server.xml` 
enables the use of the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpGraphQL-1.0.html[MicroProfile GraphQL^] 
feature in Open Liberty.
Open Liberty's MicroProfile GraphQL feature includes GraphiQL.
Enable it by setting the [hotspot=enableGraphiql file=1]`io.openliberty.enableGraphQLUI` variable to `true`.

[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/graphql/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

== Building and running the application

From the `start` directory, run the following commands:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
----

The `mvn install` command compiles and packages the object types you created to a `.jar` file.
This allows them to be used by the `system` and `graphql` services.
The `mvn package` command packages the `system` and `graphql` services to `.war` files.

Run the following command to download or update to the latest Open Liberty Docker image:

[role='command']
----
docker pull icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:full-java11-openj9-ubi
----

Dockerfiles have already been set up for you.
Build your Docker images with the following commands:

[role='command']
----
docker build -t system:1.0-java8-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java8 system/.
docker build -t system:1.0-java11-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 system/.
docker build -t graphql:1.0-SNAPSHOT graphql/.
----

The `--build-arg` parameter is used to create two different `system` services.
One uses Java 8, while the other uses Java 11.
Run these Docker images using the provided `startContainers` script. 
The script creates a network for the services to communicate through. 
It creates two `system` services and a GraphQL service.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]

[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

The containers may take some time to become available.

== Running GraphQL queries
// static guide content
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Before you make any requests, see the http://localhost:9082/graphql/schema.graphql[^] URL.
This URL returns the schema that describes the GraphQL service.
endif::[]
// cloud-hosted guide content
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Before you make any requests, select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE to open another command-line session.
Run the following command to get the schema that describes the GraphQL service:
```
curl -s http://localhost:9082/graphql/schema.graphql
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

To access the GraphQL service, GraphiQL has already been set up and included for you.
// static guide content
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Access GraphiQL at the http://localhost:9082/graphql-ui[^] URL.
endif::[]
// cloud-hosted guide content
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To access GraphiQL, run the following command and visit the resulting URL:
```
echo http://${USERNAME}-9082.$(echo $TOOL_DOMAIN | sed 's/\.labs\./.proxy./g')/graphql-ui
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

Queries that are made through GraphiQL are the same as queries that are made through HTTP requests.
You can also view the schema through GraphiQL by clicking the `Docs` button on the menu bar.

Run the following `query` operation in GraphiQL to get every system property from the container running on Java 8:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
query {
  system(hostname: "system-java8") {
    hostname
    username
    osArch
    osName
    osVersion
    systemMetrics {
      processors
      heapSize
      nonHeapSize
    }
    java {
      vendorName
      version
    }
  }
}
```
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
query {
  system(hostname: "system-java8") {
    hostname
    username
    osArch
    osName
    osVersion
    systemMetrics {
      processors
      heapSize
      nonHeapSize
    }
    java {
      vendorName
      version
    }
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

endif::[]

The output is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "hostname": "system-java8",
      "username": "default",
      "osArch": "amd64",
      "osName": "Linux",
      "osVersion": "5.10.25-linuxkit",
      "systemMetrics": {
        "processors": 4,
        "heapSize": 1031864320,
        "nonHeapSize": -1
      },
      "java": {
        "vendorName": "AdoptOpenJDK",
        "version": "1.8.0_292"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Run the following `mutation` operation to add a note to the `system` service running on Java 8:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
mutation {
  editNote(
    hostname: "system-java8"
    note: "I'm trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
  )
}
```
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
mutation {
  editNote(
    hostname: "system-java8"
    note: "I'm trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
  )
}
```
{: codeblock}

endif::[]

You receive a response containing the Boolean `true` to let you know that the request was successfully processed.
You can see the note that you added by running the following query operation.
Notice that there's no need to run a full query, as you only want the `note` property.
Thus, the request only contains the `note` property. 

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
query {
  system(hostname: "system-java8") {
    note
  }
}
```
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
query {
  system(hostname: "system-java8") {
    note
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

endif::[]

The response is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "note": "I'm trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
    }
  }
}
----

GraphQL returns only the `note` property, as it was the only property in the request.
You can try out the operations using the hostname `system-java11` as well.
To see an example of using an array as an input for an operation, try the following operation to get system loads:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
query {
  systemLoad(hostnames: ["system-java8", "system-java11"]) {
    hostname
    loadData {
      heapUsed
      nonHeapUsed
      loadAverage
    }
  }
}
```
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
query {
  systemLoad(hostnames: ["system-java8", "system-java11"]) {
    hostname
    loadData {
      heapUsed
      nonHeapUsed
      loadAverage
    }
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

endif::[]

The response is similar to the following example:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "systemLoad": [
      {
        "hostname": "system-java8",
        "loadData": {
          "heapUsed": 32432048,
          "nonHeapUsed": 85147084,
          "loadAverage": 0.36
        }
      },
      {
        "hostname": "system-java11",
        "loadData": {
          "heapUsed": 39373688,
          "nonHeapUsed": 90736300,
          "loadAverage": 0.36
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

== Tearing down the environment

When you're done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

== Great work! You're done!

You just created a basic GraphQL service using MicroProfile GraphQL in Open Liberty!
